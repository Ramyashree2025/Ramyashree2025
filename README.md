# 👋 Hi, I'm Ramyashree Doddaballapur  
**Biomedical Engineer | AI/ML Researcher | Computational Genomics | Quality Engineering s**

Welcome to my portfolio!  
I am a Biomedical Engineering graduate student at UNT with a strong background in:

- 🧬 Computational Genomics & Multi-Omics  
- 🤖 AI/ML (Python, Scikit-learn, Deep Learning)  
- 🧪 Wet-lab & Clinical Diagnostics (PCR, ELISA, cell culture)  
- 🏥 Medical Device Quality Engineering (ISO 13485, FDA 21 CFR 820)  
- ⚙️ Full-Stack Engineering (React, TypeScript, Azure SQL, GPT-4o)  

This repository consolidates all my technical, AI, biomedical, and design projects into one place.  
Each project includes **code, data pipeline, outputs, and a short explanation**.
